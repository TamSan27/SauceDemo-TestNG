https://www.saucedemo.com/ - Site which we are going to automate

// Framework overview
 Master will remain untouched
 Development will act as Prod mirror (Whatever the changes we do in features will be moved to development first, then to Master)
 Features (this is the branch where we are going to do our code)
    - Maven project we are going to use
        - we will add our all dependencies to pom.xml
    - TestNG as testing tool
    - Selenium as a technology
    - Excel sheet to provide data to the tests
